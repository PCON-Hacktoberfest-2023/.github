# How to Contribute

> **Note 1:** If you've never made a pull request before, or participated in an open-source project, we recommend taking a look at this [wonderful video tutorial](https://youtu.be/ZI2D0CI4TXs). And if you want a more complete tutorial on using github, creating branches etc. , [here's a detailed video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjQznt-8kE&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9goXbgTDQ0n_4TBzOO0ocPR).Once you've got your feet wet, you're ready to come back and dive into Hacktoberfest fun!

> **Note 2:** **Super Important** Only the pull requests created between October 1st, 2022 and October 31st, 2022 will be counted!

1. Star any repository. :stuck_out_tongue:

2. And then you have to fork (make a copy) of this repo to your Github account.

3. Clone (download) your fork to your computer.
   - [ ] <code>git clone https://github.com/PCON-Hacktoberfest-2022/<repo_name></code>
   
   - [ ] <code> cd <repo_name> </code>
   
   - [ ] In above two command replace **<repo_name>** with the name of the repository you want to work on.

4. Set your streams so you can sync your clone with the original repo (get the latest updates)

   - [ ] <code>git remote add upstream https://github.com/PCON-Hacktoberfest-2022/<repo_name></code>

   - [ ] <code>git pull upstream main</code>

   - [ ] The above 2 commands will synchronize your forked version of the project with the actual repository.

5. Make the changes in your branch. For eg. You're creating a navbar using ReactJS and your username is xyz so you've to follow the path /ReactJS/Navbar/xyz/[YOUR_REACT_FILE] and same goes with others.

6. Commit and push the code to YOUR fork.

7. Create a pull request to have the changes merged into the origin.
